# Real-Estate-ML-models
Built and tested Multiple and Polynomial Regression models based on my own manual implementation and Scikit learn on Real Estate data.

- Performed data expolartion
- Visualized the data
- Built a Multiple Linear Regression model using Scikit learn
- Experimented with the performance of Linear Regression, Lasso and Decision Tree using GridSearchCV from Scikit learn
- Built a Polynomial Regression model using Scikit learn and tested it using RMSE and R2 score
- Finally, wrote my own implementation for Multiple Linear Regression by writing methods to make predictions, calculate cost, perform batch gradient descent and scored it using RMSE and R2
